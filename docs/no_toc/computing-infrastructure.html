<p>In this chapter we will describe the basics about data size and computing capacity. We will discuss the computing and storage requirements for many types of cancer related data, as well as options to perform informatics work that might require more intensive computing capacity than your personal computer.</p>
<p><img src="14-computing-infrastructure_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gf96b1d997a_0_9.png" alt="Learning Objectives: 1. Name units of size for binary data, 2.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">15.1.1</span> Data Sizes<a href="computing-infrastructure.html#data-sizes" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Recall that the smallest unit of data is a bit which is either a zero or a one. A group of 8 bits is called a byte, and most computers and phones, and software programs are constructed or designed in a way to accommodate groups of bytes at a time. For example a 32-bit machine can work with 4 bytes at a time and a 64-bit can work with 8 bytes at a time. But how big is a file that is 2 GB? When we sequence a genome, how large is that in terms of binary data? Can our local computer work with the size of data that we would like to work with?</p>
<p>First let’s take a look at how the size of binary data is typically described and what this actually means in terms of bits and bytes:</p>
<p><img src="14-computing-infrastructure_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gfb2e21ecdc_0_8.png" alt="Table of different binary data units showing the name, abbreviation, and size in bits or bytes, for example a Byte is abbreviated as B and this represents 8 bits, while Gigabyte is abbreviated GB and represents roughly 1 billion bytes" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><img src="14-computing-infrastructure_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gfb6624a387_0_1.png" alt="Cartoon - One character says:Hey I'm so stoked. I have a super cool computer now, it has yodabytes. The other character says: Do you mean yottabytes. The original character says: Nope, I have lots of files about Yoda! The other character says: Oh dear..." width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Now that we know how to describe binary data sizes, let’s next think about how much computing capacity typical computers have today.</p>
</div>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">15.1.2</span> File Sizes<a href="computing-infrastructure.html#file-sizes" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Now let’s think about the files that we might need for our research, how big are files typically for genomic, imaging, and clinical research?</p>
<p><img src="14-computing-infrastructure_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gfb2e21ecdc_0_8.png" alt="Table of different binary data units showing the name, abbreviation, and size in bits or bytes, for example a Byte is abbreviated as B and this represents 8 bits, while Gigabyte is abbreviated GB and represents roughly 1 billion bytes" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">15.1.2.1</span> Genomic data file sizes<a href="computing-infrastructure.html#genomic-data-file-sizes" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Genomic data files can be quite large and can require quite a bit of storage and processing power.</p>
<p>Here is an image of sizes of some common file types:</p>
<p><img src="14-computing-infrastructure_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gfb2e21ecdc_0_0.png" alt="Table of file types for genomics data, whole genome sequencing can become larger than the capacity of your computer with less than 20 samples!

<h4><span class="header-section-number">15.1.2.2</span> Imaging Data File Sizes<a href="computing-infrastructure.html#imaging-data-file-sizes" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Imaging data, although often smaller than genomic data, can start to add up quickly with more images and samples.</p>
<p>Here is an table of average file sizes for various medical imaging modalities from <span class="citation">Liu et al. (<a href="#ref-liu_imaging_2017">2017</a>)</span>:</p>
<p><img src="14-computing-infrastructure_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gfb2e21ecdc_0_35.png" alt="Table of file types for imaging data, most modalities have files in the range of MB to GB.

[<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/8/4/131">source</a>]</p>
<p>Note that depending on the study requirements, several images may be needed for each sample. Thus data storage needs can add up quickly.</p>
<p><img src="14-computing-infrastructure_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gfb2e21ecdc_0_25.png" alt="Example table of overall file storage needs for samples in imaging studies." width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">15.1.2.3</span> Clinical Data File Sizes<a href="computing-infrastructure.html#clinical-data-file-sizes" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Really large clinical datasets can also produce sizable file sizes. For example the <a href="https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/db/nation/nis/nisdbdocumentation.jsp">Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS)</a> contains data on more than seven million hospital stays in the United States with regional information.</p>
<p>According to the NIS website it “enables analyses of rare conditions, uncommon treatments, and special populations” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NIS"><span>“<span>NIS</span> <span>Database</span> <span>Documentation</span>”</span> n.d.</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/db/state/sedddist/sedddist_filesize.jsp">file sizes</a> for the NIS data for different states across years, you can see that there are files for some states, such as California as large as 24,000 MB or 2.4 GB <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NIS"><span>“<span>NIS</span> <span>Database</span> <span>Documentation</span>”</span> n.d.</a>)</span>. You can see how this could add up across years and states quite quickly.</p>
<p><img src="14-computing-infrastructure_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gfb2e21ecdc_0_42.png" alt="Table of file sizes for the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS) of data from different years and states." width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

<p>These are computers that your lab might own, such as a laptop, a desktop, used by one individual or maybe just a few individuals in your lab.</p>
<p><img src="14-computing-infrastructure_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gf9c252d058_0_3.png" alt="A computer chip is also called the CPU.

<p>If you are not performing intensive computational tasks, it is possible that you will only need personal computers for your lab. However, you may find that this changes, and you might require connecting your personal computers to shared computers for more computational power and or storage.</p>
</div>
<div id="shared-computing-resources" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="15.1.3.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">15.1.3.2</span> <strong>Shared Computing Resources</strong><a href="computing-infrastructure.html#shared-computing-resources" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>What if you decide that you do need more computational power than your personal computer? You may encounter times where certain informatics tasks take way too long or are not even possible. Evaluating the potential file sizes of the data that you might be working with is a good place to start. However, keep in mind that sometimes certain computations may require more memory than you expect. This is particularly true when working with genomic or image files which are often compressed. So what can you do when you face this issue?</p>
<p>One great option, which can be quite affordable is using a server.</p>
<p>In terms of hardware, the term <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/server">server</a> means a computer (often a computer that has much more storage and computing capacity than a typical computer) or groups of computers that can be accessed by other computers using a local network or the internet to perform computations or store data <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-server_def"><strong>server_def?</strong></a>)</span>. They are often shared by people, and allow users to perform more intensive computational tasks or store large amounts of data. Read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">here</a> to learn more <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-server_2021"><strong>server_2021?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Using a group of computers is often a much more cost effective option than having one expensive supercomputer (a computer that individually has the computational power of many personal computers) to act as a server <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-supercomputer_2022"><strong>supercomputer_2022?</strong></a>)</span>. It turns out that buying several less powerful computers is cheaper. In some cases however, an institute or company might even have a sever with multiple supercomputers!</p>
<p>As an example use of a server, your lab members could connect to a server from their own computers to allow each of them more computational power. Typically computers that act as servers are set up a bit differently than our personal computers, as they do not need the same functionality and are designed to optimize data storage and computational power. For instance they often don’t have capabilities to support a <a href="https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/graphical-user-interface">graphical user interface</a> (meaning the visual display output that you see on your personal computer) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-GUI"><strong>GUI?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Instead they are typically only accessed by using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">command-line interface</a>, meaning that users write code instead of using buttons like they might for a program like Microsoft Word that uses a graphical user interface <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-command-line_2022"><strong>command-line_2022?</strong></a>)</span>. In order to support this they have memory, processors or CPUs, and storage like your laptop.</p>
<p>Here is what a server might look like:</p>
<p><img src="14-computing-infrastructure_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gf9c252d058_0_58.png" alt="A physical server is a group of computers somewhere that connects to other computers. Such a server looks something like this." width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>In this case we have a group of computers making up this server. Here we see the nodes (the individual computers that make up the server) stacked in columns.</p>
<p>Among shared computing resources/servers there are three major options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clusters</strong> - institutional or national resources</li>
<li><strong>Grids</strong> - institutional or national resources</li>
<li><strong>Cloud</strong> - commercial or national resources</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="computer-cluster" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="15.1.3.3">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">15.1.3.3</span> Computer Cluster<a href="computing-infrastructure.html#computer-cluster" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>In a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster">computing cluster</a> several of the <strong>same</strong> type of computer (often in close proximity and connected by a local area network with actual cables or an <a href="https://www.igloosoftware.com/blog/internet-vs-intranet-vs-extranet-whats-the-difference/">intranet</a> rather than the internet) work together to perform pieces of the same single task simultaneously <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-computer_cluster_2022"><strong>computer_cluster_2022?</strong></a>)</span>. The idea of performing multiple computations simultaneously is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing">parallel computing</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-parallel_2021"><strong>parallel_2021?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>There are different designs or architectures for clusters. One common one is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf_cluster">Beowulf cluster</a> in which a master computer (called front node or server node) breaks a task up into small pieces that the other computers (called <strong>client nodes</strong> or simply <strong>nodes</strong>) perform <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-beowulf_2022"><strong>beowulf_2022?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>For example, if a large file needs to be converted to a different format, <strong>pieces</strong> of the file will be converted simultaneously by the different nodes. Thus each node is performing the <strong>same task</strong> just with different pieces of the file. The user has to write code in a special way to specify that they want parallel processing to be used and how. See <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-supercharge-your-bash-workflows-with-gnu-parallel-53aab0aea141/">here</a> for an introduction about how this is done <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Zach_Caceres_GNU_Parallel_2019"><strong>Zach_Caceres_GNU_Parallel_2019?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>It is important to realize that the CPUs in each of the node computers connected within a cluster are all performing a similar task simultaneously.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cs.wmich.edu/~elise/courses/cs626/s09/hussein/Parallel_and_Cluster_Computing.pdf">here</a> for more information <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-de_doncker"><strong>de_doncker?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="computer-grid" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="15.1.3.4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">15.1.3.4</span> Computer Grid<a href="computing-infrastructure.html#computer-grid" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>In a <a href="https://hazelcast.com/glossary/grid-computing/">computing grid</a> are often <strong>different</strong> types of computers in <strong>different</strong> locations work towards an overall common goal by performing <strong>different</strong> tasks <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-grid"><strong>grid?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Again, just like computer clusters, there are many types of architectures that can be rather simple to very complex. For example you can think of different universities collaborating to perform different computations for the same project. One university might perform computations using gene expression data about a particular population, while another performs computations using data from another population. Importantly each of these universities might use clusters to perform their specific task.</p>
<p>Both grids and clusters use a special type of software called middleware to coordinate the various computers involved.
Users need to write their scripts in a way that can be performed by multiple computers simultaneously. Users also need to be conscious of how to schedule their tasks and to follow the rules and etiquette of the specific cluster or grid that they are sharing (more on that soon!).</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">15.1.3.5</span> “Cloud” computing<a href="computing-infrastructure.html#cloud-computing" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>More recently, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">“Cloud”</a> has become a common computing option. The term “cloud” has become a widely used buzzword <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cha_cloud_2015"><strong>cha_cloud_2015?</strong></a>)</span> that actually has a few slightly different definitions that have changed overtime, making it a bit tricky to keep track of. However, the “cloud” is typically meant to describe large computing resources that involve the connection of <strong>multiple servers</strong> in multiple locations to one another <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cloud_2022"><strong>cloud_2022?</strong></a>)</span> using the internet. See <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/cloud-vs-virtualization">here</a> for a deeper description of what the term cloud means today and how it compares to other more traditional shared computing options <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cloud_deeper"><strong>cloud_deeper?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Many of us use cloud storage regularly for Google Docs and backing up photos using iPhoto and Google. Cloud computing for research works in a similar way to these systems, in that you can perform computations or store data using an available server that is part of a larger network of servers. This allows for even more computational dependability beyond a more simple cluster or grid. Even if one or multiple servers is down, you can often still use the other servers for the computations that you might need.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this also allows for more opportunity to scale your work to a larger extent, as there is generally more computing capacity possible with most cloud resources <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cloudvstrad"><strong>cloudvstrad?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft Azure, and others provide cloud computing resources. <strong>Somewhere these companies have clusters of computers that paying customers use through the internet.</strong> In addition to these commercial options, there are newer national government funded resource options like <a href="https://portal.xsede.org/jetstream">Jetstream</a> (described in the next section). We will compare computing options in another chapter coming up.</p>

<p>It’s important to remember that all of the shared computing options that we previously described involve a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center">data center</a> where are large number of computers are physically housed.</p>
<p><img src="14-computing-infrastructure_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gf9c252d058_0_23.png" alt="Examples of servers or shared computers include clusters  that may exist at your institution or national computing resources like Xsede." width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>You may have access to a <a href="https://www.hpc.iastate.edu/guides/introduction-to-hpc-clusters/what-is-an-hpc-cluster">HPC (which stands for High Performance Computing) cluster</a> at your institute. This can be a great cost-effective and typically secure option.</p>
<p>If your university or institution has a HPC <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster">cluster</a>, this means that they have a group of computers acting like a server that people can use to store data or assist with intensive computations. Often institutions can support the cost of many computers within an HPC cluster. This means that multiple computers will simultaneously perform different parts of the computing required for a given task, thus significantly speeding up the process compared to you trying to perform the task on just your computer!</p>
<p>If your institute doesn’t have a shared computing resource like the HPCs we just described, you could also consider a national resource option like <a href="https://www.xsede.org/">Xsede</a>.
<a href="https://www.xsede.org/">Xsede</a> is led by the University of Illinois National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and includes 18 other partnering institutions (which are mostly other universities). Through this partnership, they currently support 16 supercomputers. Universities and non-profit researchers in the United States can request access to their computational and data storage resources. See <a href="https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/resource-info">here</a> for descriptions of the available resources.</p>

<p>Stampede2, generously funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) through award ACI-1134872, is one of the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), University of Texas at Austin’s flagship supercomputers.</p>

<p>Importantly when you use shared computers like national resources like Stampede2 available through Xsede, as well as institutional HPCs, you will share these resources with many other people and so you need to learn the proper etiquette for using and sharing these resources.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.2</span> Shared Computing Etiquette<a href="computing-infrastructure.html#shared-computing-etiquette" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In this chapter we will discuss the proper etiquette for using more traditional shared computing resources, such as an institutional high performance computing cluster server. This will help you to understand what would be required for you to use such resources. Different resources will have slightly different use rules, however, many resources will share common usage requirements. The following is written based on personal experience, the <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-doi_rules"><strong>doi_rules?</strong></a>)</span> and the <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-JHPCE"><strong>JHPCE?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="14-computing-infrastructure_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_g11383d0152c_0_12.png" alt="Learning Objectives: 1. Describe why traditional shared computing resources need usage rules, 2. Define common best practices for proper etiquette on traditional shared computing resources" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We will use the Johns Hopkins Joint High Performance Computing Exchange (JHPCE) cluster resource as an example to motivate the need for usage rules and proper sharing etiquette for such resources.</p>
<p>First let’s learn a bit about this JHPCE. For this particular resource there are about 400 active users.It is optimized for genomic and biomedical research and has 4,000 cores! That’s right, as you can imagine, this is much more powerful than the individual laptops and desktops that researchers at the university have for personal use, which would typically currently only have around 8 cores. There is also 28TB of RAM and 14 PB of storage!</p>
<p>Now that you know more about digital sizes, you can appreciate that this server can allow for much faster processing and really large amounts of storage, as again a researchers’ computer might have something like 16 GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.</p>
<p>There are 68 nodes that make up the JHPCE currently. As, with most clusters some of the nodes are dedicated to managing users logging in to the cluster and some of the nodes are dedicated to data transferring. Each node has 2-4 CPUs that provide 24-128 cores! As you can see these processors or chips have a lot more cores per each CPU than a typical personal computer.</p>
<p>Individual users connect and perform jobs (aka computational tasks) on the cluster using a formal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common-pool_resource">common pool resource (CPR)</a> hierarchy system. What does this mean? This means that it is a shared resource, where if one user overused the resource it would be to the detriment of others and to overcome this there are usage rules and regulations that are enforced by managers of the resource <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-common-pool_2022"><strong>common-pool_2022?</strong></a>)</span>. This is important because if a single or a few users used up all the computing resources one day, then the other nearly 400 users would have to delay their work that day, which would not be fair.</p>
<div id="general-guidelines-for-shared-computing-resources" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="15.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">15.2.1</span> General Guidelines for shared computing resources<a href="computing-infrastructure.html#general-guidelines-for-shared-computing-resources" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Each cluster or other shared computing resource will have different rules and requirements, but here are a few general rules to keep in make sure that you don’t accidentally abuse the privilege of sharing an amazing resource like this. Don’t be too worried, most shared resources will give you guidance about their specific rules and will often also have settings that don’t allow users to make major blunders.</p>
<div id="security-guidelines" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="15.2.1.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">15.2.1.1</span> Security guidelines<a href="computing-infrastructure.html#security-guidelines" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>One major aspect to consider is keeping the computers in the cluster safe from harm. You wouldn’t want to lose your precious data stored on the cluster and neither would your colleagues!</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a good <a href="https://privsec.harvard.edu/use-strong-passwords">secure password</a> that is not easy for someone else to guess.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people suggest using sentences that are easy for you to remember, you could consider a line of lyrics from song or poem that you like, or maybe a movie. Modify part of it to include symbols and numbers <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-passwords"><strong>passwords?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="14-computing-infrastructure_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_g11383d0152c_0_22.png" alt="Cartoon - One character says:I came up with the best password! It’s from Elton John’s Rocket Man song. And all this science I don’t understand It’s just my job five days a week A rocket man A rocket man. All the Os are zeros. The other character says: That is super good! But remember you aren’t supposed to share your passwords. Plus now all the readers of this chapter know too.The original character says: Oh shoot… you’re right. The other character says: It’s OK, sounds like you can come up with another." width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t share your password and keep it safe!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a Mac, you could consider storing it in your <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ie/guide/mac-help/mchlf375f392/mac">Keychain</a>, alternatively if you have a different type of computer or don’t like the Mac Keychain, consider <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/">Dashlane</a> or other password manger services. Luckily both of these options do not come at any extra cost and can be helpful for storing all the passwords we use regularly safely. These are especially good options if your password is difficult for you to remember. Make sure that you abide by any rules regarding storing passwords that might be required by the resource you intend to use.</p>
<p><img src="14-computing-infrastructure_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_g10e2895be5b_58_54.png" alt="Cartoon - One character says: Hey, what do you have there?.

You could also just use a password manager. The other character says: Oh that might be good… because this fireproof box is quite heavy!" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t access a server on a computer that is not authorized to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some servers will require that your computer be authorized for access for added security. It’s a good idea to follow these rules. If you can, perhaps authorize a laptop in case you might need to gain access when you need to be out of town. However if you do so, make sure you also only access such servers with a secure WiFi network. One way to ensure this is is to avoid using public WiFi networks. If you must use a public WiFi network, consider using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">virtual private network (VPN)</a> for added security. Here is an <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/best-vpn/">article</a> about different VPN options <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gilbertson_4_2021"><strong>gilbertson_4_2021?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not alter security settings without authorization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Loosening security settings could pose a risk to the data stored on the server. On the other hand, making more strict security settings could cause other users to not be able to perform their work. Contact the managers of the resource if you think changes need to be made.</p>
<ul>
<li>Immediately report any data security concerns.</li>
</ul>
<p>To protect the integrity of your data and your colleagues, be sure to report anything strange about the shared computing resource to those who manage it so that they can address it right away. Also report to them if you have any security breaches on the computer(s) that you use to access the shared computing resource.</p>

<div id="overall-use-guidelines" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="15.2.1.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">15.2.1.2</span> Overall use guidelines<a href="computing-infrastructure.html#overall-use-guidelines" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Now that we know how to keep the resource safe, let’s next talk about general usage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t install software unless you have permission.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible that the software you want to use might already be installed somewhere on the shared computing resource that you are unaware about. In addition, if you install a different version of a software program, it is possible that this version (especially if it is newer) will get automatically called by other people’s scripts. This could actually break their scripts or modify their results. They may have a reason to use an older version of that software, do not assume that they necessarily want the updated version. Instead, let the managers of the resource know. They can inform other users and make sure that everyone’s work will not be disrupted.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t use the server for storage or computation that you are not authorized for.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is often a rule for shared computing resources, simply because such shared resources are intended for a specific reason and likely funded for that reason. Such resources are costly, and therefore the computational power should be used only for what it is intended for, otherwise people may view the use of the resources for other purposes as essentially theft.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t alter configurations without authorization.</li>
</ul>
<p>This could result unintended and unexpected consequences for other users.</p>
</div>
<div id="daily-use-guidelines" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="15.2.1.3">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">15.2.1.3</span> Daily use guidelines<a href="computing-infrastructure.html#daily-use-guidelines" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Now let’s discuss how you should use such resources on a daily basis.</p>
<p>When you submit jobs, make sure you follow the following guidelines. Again consider the fact that there may be more or different requirements for the specific resource that you might be using.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t use the login or transfer nodes for your computations.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will cause issues for other users in terms of logging in and transferring their data. This could cause them to be unable to do their work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Think about memory allocation and efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider how much RAM and storage is available for people on the shared computing resource. Try not to overload the resource with a really intensive job or jobs that will use most of the resources and either slow down the efficiency of the work for others or not allow them to perform their work at all.</p>
<p>This involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not using too many nodes if you don’t need to</li>
<li>Not using too much RAM on a given node or overall if you don’t need to</li>
<li>Not submitting too many jobs at once</li>
<li>Communicating with others to give them advanced warning if you are going to submit large or intensive jobs</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a really large job that you need to perform, talk with the managers of the resource so that you can work out a time when perhaps fewer users would be inconvenienced. Consult the guidelines for your particular resource about how one let’s people know about large jobs before you email the administrators of the resource directly. Often their are communications systems in place for users to let each other know about large jobs.</p>
</div>
<div id="communication-guidelines" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="15.2.1.4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">15.2.1.4</span> Communication Guidelines<a href="computing-infrastructure.html#communication-guidelines" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Speaking of communication, let’s dive into that deeper for a bit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the proper order for communication.</li>
</ul>
<p>Often shared resources have rules about how they want people to communicate. For example for some resources it is suggested that you first ask your friends and colleagues if you are confused about something, then consult any available forums, if that does not work then directly email the administrators/managers of the resource. Keep in mind that these people are very busy and get lots of communications.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the ticket system</li>
</ul>
<p>If a resource has a ticket system for users to get support, use it instead of communicating by email. If such a system is in place, then the administrators running it are used to getting requests this way. If you email directly, you may not receive feedback in a timely manner or the email might get lost.</p>
</div>
<div id="specific-rules" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="15.2.1.5">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">15.2.1.5</span> Specific Rules<a href="computing-infrastructure.html#specific-rules" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Ultimately it is very important to learn about the rules, practices, and etiquette for the resource that you are using and to follow them. Otherwise, you could lose access. Often other users are a great resource!</p>

<p>Often you will need to use the command line to interact with a server from your personal computer. To do so on a Mac or a Linux computer you can typically do so using the terminal program that is already on your computer. For PC or Windows computer users, you can use programs like <a href="http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/">MobaXterm</a>.</p>
<p>If you wish to run a program with a graphical interface, then you might need to have a program to help you do so. On Macs, you can download <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/">XQuartz</a>. If you use MobaXterm on your PC or Windows computer, then you will already be set. Linux computers also typically should already have what you need.</p>

<div id="running-jobs" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="15.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">15.2.3</span> Running Jobs<a href="computing-infrastructure.html#running-jobs" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Typically a program is used to schedule jobs. Remember that jobs are the individual computational tasks that you ask the server to run. For example, this could be something as simple as moving large files from one directory to another or as complex as running a complicated script on a file.</p>
<p>Such job scheduling programs assign jobs to available node resources as they become available and if they have the required resources to meet the job. These programs have their own commands for running jobs, checking resources, and checking jobs. Remember to use the management system to run your jobs using the compute nodes not the login nodes (nodes for users to log in). There are often nodes set up for transferring files as well.</p>
<p>In the case of the JHPCE, a program called Sun Grid Engine (SGE) is used, but there are others job management programs. See <a href="https://jhpce.jhu.edu/orient/orientation-overview/">here</a> for more information on how people use SGE for the JHPCE shared resource.</p>
<div id="specifying-memory-ram-needs" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="15.2.3.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">15.2.3.1</span> Specifying memory (RAM) needs<a href="computing-infrastructure.html#specifying-memory-ram-needs" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Often there is a default file size limit for jobs. For example the JHPCE has a 10GB file size limit for jobs. You may need to specify when you have a job using a file that exceeds the file size limit and set the file size for that job. As you may recall if you are using whole genome files you are likely to exceed the default file limit size. Often you are also given a default amount of RAM for your job as well. Again, you can typically run a job with more RAM if you specify. Similar to the file size limit, you will likely need to set the RAM that you will need for your job if it is above the default limit. Often this involves setting a lower and upper limit to the RAM that your job can use. If your job exceeds that amount of RAM it will be stopped. Typically people call stopping a job “killing” it. The lower and upper limit can be the same number.</p>
<p>How do you know how much RAM to assign to your job? Well if you are performing a job with files that are two times the size of the file size default limit, then it might make sense to double the RAM you would typically use. It’s also a good idea to test on one file first if you are going to perform the same job on multiple files. You can then assess how much RAM the job used. First try to perform the job with lower limits and progressively increase until you see that the job was successful and not killed for exceeding the limit. Keep in mind however how much RAM there is on each node. Remember, it is important to not ask for all the RAM on a single node or core on that node, as this will result in you hogging that node and other users will not be able to use RAM on that node or core on that node. Remember that you will likely have the option to use multiple cores, this can also help you to use less RAM across each core. For example, a job that needs 120GB of RAM could use 10 cores with 12 GB of RAM each.</p>
<p>Often there will be a limit for the number of jobs, the amount of RAM, and the number of cores that a single user can use beyond the default limits. This is to ensure that a user doesn’t use too many resources causing others to not be able to perform their jobs. Check to see what these limits are and then figure out what the appropriate way is to contact to request for more. Again communication standards and workflows may vary based on the resource.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">15.2.3.2</span> Checking status<a href="computing-infrastructure.html#checking-status" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>It’s also a good idea to check the status of your jobs to see if they worked or got killed. You can check for the expected file outputs or there are commands for the server management software that can help you check currently running jobs.</p>
</div>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">15.2.4</span> Storage<a href="computing-infrastructure.html#storage" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Often you will be given a home directory which will likely be backed up, however, other storage directories often will not be. Be careful about where you store your data, as some directories might be for temporary use and get wiped to keep space available for others.</p>

<p>In this chapter we will provide examples of computing platforms that are designed to help researchers and that you might find useful for your work. Please note that we aim to provide a general overview of options and thus this is not a complete list. Let us know if there is a platform or system that you think we should include!</p>
<div class="warning">
<p>We highly suggest you also <strong>read the next chapter</strong>, which will point out important considerations to think about when deciding to work on a shared computing resource platform like those discussed in this chapter.</p>

<p><img src="14-computing-infrastructure_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gf5f8818810_1_171.png" alt="Learning Objectives: 1.Recognize general informatics computing and data management platforms. 2.Be aware of differnt benefits of the various platforms" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The major advantage of these platforms is that users can analyze data where it lives, as many platforms host public data. However, some also allow you to upload your own data. There is less need for data transfers back and forth to your personal computer, as you can analyze your data, store your data and share it in one place, saving time. Users can sometimes also share how they did their analysis as well, improving reproducibility practices. Additionally, another advantage is that some of these platforms also provide educational material on how to work with data.</p>
<p>Many offer a <a href="https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/graphical-user-interface">graphical user interface</a> also simply called just graphical interface or GUI, allows for users to choose functions to perform by interacting with visual representations, which can be useful for individuals how are less comfortable writing code. They have a “user-centered” design that creates a visual environment where users can for example <strong>click on</strong> tabs, boxes, or icons for to perform functions. This also often allows users to more directly see plots and other types of visualizations.</p>
<p>Some platforms also offer a <a href="https://searchwindowsserver.techtarget.com/definition/command-line-interface-CLI">command line interface</a> (also known as a character interface) which allows for software functions to be performed by specifying through commands written in text. This typically offers more control than a GUI, however command line interfaces are often less user friendly as they require that the user know the correct commands to use.</p>

<p>Galaxy is a web-based computational workbench that connects analysis tools, biomedical datasets, computing resources, a graphical user interface, and a programmatic API. Galaxy (<a href="https://galaxyproject.org/" class="uri">https://galaxyproject.org/</a>) enables accessible, reproducible, and collaborative biomedical data science by anyone regardless of their informatics expertise. There are more than 8,000 analysis tools and 200 visualizations integrated into Galaxy that can be used to process a wide variety of biomedical datasets. This includes tools for analyzing genomic, transcriptomic (RNA-seq), proteomic, metabolomic, microbiome, and imaging datasets, tool suites for single-cell omics and machine learning, and thousands of more tools. Galaxy’s graphical user interface can be used with only a web browser, and there is a programmatic API for performing scripted and automated analyses with Galaxy.</p>
<p><img src="14-computing-infrastructure_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gfb2e21ecdc_0_131.png" alt="Galaxy can be accessed through a web browser and provides users with access to tools, datasets, computing resources, a graphical user interface (GUI) for users who would like to interact with Galaxy by clicking buttons and using drop-down menus and a programmtic API for users that would like to write code to interact with Galaxy" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Galaxy is used daily by thousands of scientists across the world. A vibrant Galaxy community has deployed hundreds of Galaxy servers across the world, including more than 150 public and three large national/international servers in the United States, Europe, and Australia (<a href="https://usegalaxy.org" class="uri">https://usegalaxy.org</a>, <a href="https://usegalaxy.eu" class="uri">https://usegalaxy.eu</a>, <a href="https://usegalaxy.org.au" class="uri">https://usegalaxy.org.au</a>). The three national/international servers have more than 250,000 registered users who execute &gt;500,000 analysis jobs each month. Galaxy has been cited more than 10,000 times with &gt;20% from papers related to cancer. The Galaxy Tool Shed (<a href="https://usegalaxy.org/toolshed" class="uri">https://usegalaxy.org/toolshed</a>) provides a central location where developers can upload tools and visualizations and users can search and install tools and visualizations into any Galaxy server. Galaxy has a large presence in the cancer research community. Galaxy serves as an integration and/or analysis platform for 7 projects in the NCI ITCR program. There is also increasing use of Galaxy in key NIH initiatives such as the NCI Cancer Moonshot Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) and the NHGRI Data Commons, called the AnVIL (<a href="https://anvilproject.org/" class="uri">https://anvilproject.org/</a>).</p>

<p>Galaxy’s user interface, accessible via a web browser, provides access to all Galaxy functionality. The main Galaxy interface has three panels: available tools (left), running analyses and viewing data (middle), and a full history of tools run and datasets generated (right).</p>
<p><img src="14-computing-infrastructure_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gfb2e21ecdc_0_111.png" alt="Galaxy user interface showing the 3 panels: left = tools, middle = analysis and data, and right = history and generated datasets" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Datasets for analysis in Galaxy can be <strong>uploaded</strong> from a laptop or desktop computer or obtained from public data repositories connected to Galaxy. With Galaxy, complex workflows composed of tens or even hundreds of analysis tools can be created and run. In Galaxy’s workflow interface, tools can be added and connected via a simple drag-and-drop approach.</p>
<p><img src="14-computing-infrastructure_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gfb2e21ecdc_0_141.png" alt="Galaxy workflow example showing the beginning steps of a workflow" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Galaxy users can share all their work—analysis histories, workflows, and visualizations—via simple URLs that are available to specific colleagues or a link that anyone can access. Galaxy’s user interface is highly scalable. Tens, hundreds, or even thousands of datasets can be grouped into collections and run in parallel using individual tools or multi-tool workflows. In summary, Galaxy is a popular computational workbench with tools and features for a wide variety of data analyses, and it has broad usage in cancer data analysis.</p>

<p><a href="https://cyverse.rocks/about">CyVerse</a> is a similar computing platform that also offers computing resources for storing, sharing, and working with data with a graphical interface, as well as an API. Computing was previously offered using the cloud computing platform from CyVerse called <a href="https://cyverse.org/news/refocusing-atmosphere-support-cloud-native-development">Atmosphere</a>, which relied on users using virtual machines. Users will now use a new version of Atmosphere with partnership with <a href="https://jetstream-cloud.org/">Jetstream</a>. This allows users to use containers for easier collaboration and also offers US users more computing power and storage. Originally called iPlant Collaborative, it was started by a funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support life sciences research, particularly to support ecology, biodiversity, sustainability, and agriculture research. It is led by the University of Arizona, the Texas Advanced Computing Center, and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. It offers access to an environment for performing analyses with Jupyter (for Python mostly) and RStudio (for R mostly) and a variety of tools for Genomic data analysis. See <a href="https://cyverse.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEapps/pages/241882146/List+of+Applications">here</a> for a list of applications that are supported by CyVerse.

<p>SciServer is accessible through a web browser and allows users to store, upload, download, share, and work with data and common tools on the same platform. It was originally built for the astrophysics community (and called SkyServer) but it has now been adapted to be used by scientists of all fields and is indeed used by many in the genomics field. It allows users to use Python and R in environments like Jupyter notebooks and RStudio, and also supports (Structured Query Language) SQL for data querying and management and is built on the use of Docker.</p>
<p>The main idea of SciServer, is based on this premise: “bring the analysis to the data”. It is free to use after users register. However, users can buy extra resources. Users can keep data private or share their data.</p>
<p>As compared to Galaxy, this resources may be better for users with a bit more familiarity with informatics but who require more flexibility, particularly for working with collaborators such as physicists or material scientists as there are more tools supported across disciplines. In addition it also gives users access to very large data sets on Petabyte-scale (note that some of these require special permission to use) and supports developers to create their own web interfaces called SciUIs for particular use cases.</p>

<p>The Platform for Imaging in Precision Medicine called PRISM works behind the scenes in the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) to allow users to work with the vast data available in TCIA, in terms of both imaging data and clinical information.</p>
<p>According to Fred Prior:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is designed to collect, curate and manage Radiology and Pathology images, clinical information associated with those images, annotations and image derived feature sets. PRISM is designed to run on a Kubernettes cluster, but all of the components are containerized so they can run stand-alone or in an alternate orchestration framework.</p>
