{choose-answers: 4}
? What is repeatability?

C) The same researcher repeats an analysis without changing anything and gets the same result
C) A researcher repeats the same process or analysis without changing anything and gets the same result
m) Repeating your analysis with different data and getting the same result
m) Repeating your analysis with the different data and getting the same result
o) It is the same as reproducibility
o) It is the same as replicability

? What is reproducibility?

C) A different analyst re-performs an analysis or protocol with the same code and the same data and gets the same result
C) Someone else uses the same code or protocol and the same data and gets the same results
m) Someone else uses different code and the same data and gets the same result
m) Someone else uses the same code and different data and gets the same result
o) Someone uses the same code at a different time with different data and gets the same results
o) Someone uses different data at a different time and gets the same result



{choose-answers: 4}
? What is replicability?

C) Another researcher uses new data and a new analysis approach but gets the same result
C) A different research uses new data and a new analysis as someone else but gets the same result
m) A different person or team uses the same data and code or protocol and gets the same result
m) A different researcher uses the same data and code or experimental protocol and gets the result
o) The same person gets the same result with the same data and code or protocol
o) The same person gets different results with different data and the same code or protocol

{choose-answers: 4}
? Which of the following is true?

C) All of the answers are correct
C) All of the answers are true
m) If an analysis is repeatable then it might be reproducible and replicable
m) If your results are not repeatable they can not be reproducible
o) Replicability builds on reproducibility which builds on repeatability
o) If you can't get the same results twice then someone else is unlikely to use your code/protocol and data or samples and obtain similar results



{choose-answers: 4}
? Which of the following is NOT true?

C) Following best practices for reproducibility doesn't help you if you try to use old code to adjust an analysis or protocol in the future
C) Following best practices for reproducibility doesn't help your research be more transparent
m) Reproducibility exists on a continuum, it is something we aim to improve over time
m) Reproducibility practices take more time day to day but save time in the long run
o) Your analysis/protocol being reproducible doesn't mean it is correct
o) Following best practices for reproducibility encourages others to reuse your analysis code or protocol
