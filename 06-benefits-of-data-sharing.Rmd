# Discussion on Benefits of Data Management and Sharing

## Discussion

Please see below for a self-directed reflection.

<div class = "reflection">

Before beginning this course, you may not have thought much about data management and data sharing as it relates to your project. If have written a grant proposal, you understand that writing grants takes time and can be a lot of work. Before this course, you may have thought that adding an additional plan about data management and sharing to your proposal would just be more paperwork. 

With what you have learned so far in this course, if applicable, consider some ways that sharing your data and managing it effectively might benefit you, your fellow cancer researchers, and the public in the long term.
